A study conducted using Histogram of Oriented Gradients  features and SVM to recognize ships in satelite imagery. The original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rhammell/ships-in-satellite-imagery) and a kernel I submitted to Kaggle can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/manikg/training-svm-classifier-with-hog-features). This version is slighltly ahead of the Kaggle version and a WIP towards using sliding window to scan a scene for ship images.
